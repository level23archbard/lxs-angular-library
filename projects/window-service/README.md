# window-service

This library contains a service named `WindowService`, which can be injected to provide a safe `window` to any interested injector. It requires the `WindowModule` is imported in order to use.

## Module Configuration

Add the following import to your module:
`import { WindowModule } from '@level23archbard/window-service';`

And add the `WindowModule` item to the NgModule.imports array.
